Born in [San Vicente, Chile](https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Vicente+de+Tagua+Tagua,+San+Vicente,+O'Higgins,+Chile/@-34.440399,-71.0664003,2338a,35y,273.68h,44.28t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x9664821410d251fb:0x519dd94a951fefa7!8m2!3d-34.4349435!4d-71.0913748!16s%2Fm%2F04ybm4m?entry=ttu) and raised in New Zealand. My purpose as a UX designer is about using design as a positive force, creating a more inclusive, efficient, and ethical digital world.

Currently designing at AKQA Tāmaki Makaurau.

Here on my personal site, I write about [building static websites with Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [improving privacy and security online](/topics/privacy/)  and the [tools I use](/uses/), day to day.

Once a month I curate [a newsletter for web designs and developers](/newsletter/) interested in static sites, web performance, privacy and sustainability.

I'm currently working on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) – a course about building resilient websites with Hugo – and laying the foundations of [my web dev studio](https://studioeryn.com/).

## Interests

- Film photography (35mm, delving into B&W)
- Working on community projects (View [social programs](/social-projects/) I've worked on)
- Cooking for friends & family (favourite dish: casuela de vacuno)

## Philosophy

- I strive to design with a core focus on empathy, perspective and users
- I collaborate with people who inspire me to grow and I try to inspire others
- I aim to learn, improve and challenge myself every day
