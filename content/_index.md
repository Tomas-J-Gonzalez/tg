I write [articles on design and code](/articles/) and curate [a ~~weekly~~ monthly newsletter](/newsletter/) for designers and front-end web developers. I also keep [notes on things](/notes/) I’m learning.

Currently I live between London and Hamburg, where I work with a handful of clients. In my free time I enjoy running, climbing, hiking and skiing in winter. I practice yoga and meditation most mornings.
