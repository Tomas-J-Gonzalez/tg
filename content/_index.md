Currently designing at AKQA Tāmaki Makaurau.

Here on my personal site, I write about [building static websites with Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [improving privacy and security online](/topics/privacy/)  and the [tools I use](/uses/), day to day.


## Philosophy

 My purpose as an Experience designer is about using design as a positive force, creating a more inclusive, efficient, and ethical digital world.
