{{< intro >}}A growing collection of personal projects I'm working on. You'll also find projects from the past, which are either defunct, not maintained or that I'm no longer a part of.{{</ intro >}}

## Active projects

[Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com) is a course on building leaner, faster, more resilient websites with [Hugo](/topics/hugo). I plan to release the first season later this year.

[Brand guide](https://design.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/) is a Hugo theme I use to create brand guideline microsites for my clients.

[Local London](https://locallondon.life) is a directory of independent, London based food & drink makers. I started the project with my friend Rozzy in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, to help support local makers. It's now run by [Rebekka](https://rebekkawrites.com/).

[Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a type foundry I set up in 2017 which focuses on hand drawn fonts and imperfection in type design.

## Past projects

[In Detail](https://indtl.com/). An engagememnt ring concierge service which started life as a jewellery blog. I co-founded the project back in 2011, with Jewellery consultant Beanie Major.

[Remote Cards](https://remotecards.netlify.app/) is a fun card generator tool for promoting live streaming events. I built this with my brother [Ben](https://benmclaren.xyz/) during the first week of the Covid-19 lockdown.

[trashmonster](https://trashmonster.netlify.app/). In what feels like a lifetime a go I spent a good amount of my time screen printing, painting and creating 3D street installations.
