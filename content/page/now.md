### Recent Projects

- [Local London](https://locallondon.life/interview) is now sharing stories from London food and drink founders.

- I just built [a style guide generator with Eleventy](https://github.com/harrycresswell/design-tokens-eleventy), which takes a set of [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) stored as yaml data and turns them into Sass variables to use in your styles, and JSON to use in your templates. The idea is inspired by [Andy Bell’s Hylia Starter Kit](https://hylia.website/styleguide/).
