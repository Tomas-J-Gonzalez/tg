I’m finally back in Hamburg after 4 months stuck in London. Life is finally returning to normal. This is how I’m spending my time right now.

- I just built [a style guide generator with Eleventy](https://github.com/harrycresswell/design-tokens-eleventy), which takes a set of [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) stored as yaml data and turns them into Sass variables to use in your styles, and JSON to use in your templates. The idea is inspired by [Andy Bell’s Hylia Starter Kit](https://hylia.website/styleguide/).
