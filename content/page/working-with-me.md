{{< intro >}}Here are a few ideas of how we can work together and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.{{< /intro >}}

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent designer and front-end web developer from London, England.

I’ve spent the last 8 years helping startups and independent individuals set up online.

## What I do

From early stage concepts through to product lauch, I wireframe, prototype and code content based websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I specialise in creating [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and eCommerce stores using [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I am well versed in content modeling and creating content management systems using [Forestry](https://forestry.io/), [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

I tend to build clean, simple websites, with a focus on typography. I don’t belive in overcomplicating things. Expect a performant, robust website which is quick to load and cost effective to run.

## What I don’t do

If you are looking to build a native IOS or Andriod app, or anything powered by user driven data, then I’m not the right person for the job.

If you have a ridculous brief like “Just make people go WOW” (yes, that was the brief) or aren’t prepared to offer any input or direction, then I suggest looking elsewhere.

If you’re looking to tweak an existing theme, you need help with your Squarespace, Wix site or Bebo page, then I’m not your guy. There was a time, but thankfully that time has now past.

## How I work

I believe communication and collaboration are vital to the success of a project. I like to ask questions and involve clients in every step of product development, so we’re on the same page from start to finish.

I keep my process dynamic and as fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction until we find the right solution.

## Who hires me

I work with startups, small independent businesses, agencies and individuals looking for a web developer who understands design, and knows how to turn ideas from design mockups into code.

My clients are keen to execute ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills or time to do so. They would rather invest their budget in good design, at an affordable rate, from an independent designer. Rather than spending the earth on agency fees.

## What I charge

My rate varies depending on your situation and needs.

If you are an independent individual just starting out, then I will charge a considerable amount less than if you are an established business who has just raised investment. If you are a non-profit organisation or charity then I will often waiver my fee entirely.

I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

## Get in touch

If you have a project in mind, and you think I might be a good fit, then [let’s talk about it](/contact/) and we can take it from there.
