## Who I am

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent designer and front-end web developer from London, England.

I’ve spent the last 7 years helping startup businesses and independent individuals get set up online.

## What I do

To put it simply I design and code websites.

From concept through to launch, I can help you with research and planning, wireframing, prototyping designs and building out those finished designs in code.

I specialise in creating content based websites and custom eCommerce stores using [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/). If you are looking for an app developer, or someone to help create a website driven by user data, then I’m probably not your guy.

The websites I build are performant, optimised for search engines and meet accessibility standards, so you can include those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers as your customers.

## How I work

I believe that research, understanding, communication and collaboration are integral to the success of a project. So I’m big on all these things.

I like to keep the process as dynamic and fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction, until we find the right solution.

I’m not afraid to ask questions, sometimes they might sound like silly ones, but the better I understand your vision, the sooner I can help you create the right product.

I won’t disappear for weeks on end before eventually delivering a product which doesn’t meet your expectations. Instead we’ll be in conversation through every stage of product development, so we’re on the same page from start to finish.

## Who hires me

I work with startups, small businesses, agencies and individuals who need a web developer with a good understanding of design and has experience launching products online.

My clients tend to be those keen to execute ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Or those who’d rather save on big agency fees by investing their budget in good design, at an affordable rate, from an independent designer.

## What I charge

My rate is £1.5k — £2.5k per week, depending on the requirements and my involvement in the project. I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

## Get in touch

Have a project in mind and think I might be a good fit? [Let’s have a chat](/contact/) and we can take it from there. If I can’t help you out personally, I may know someone who can.
