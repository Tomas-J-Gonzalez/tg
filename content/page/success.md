Thanks for your message. It’s flying through the internet right now.

Forgive me if I don’t reply right away, I receive a lot of messages so I tend to pause my inbox to limit distraction from email to once per day. I will aim to get back to you within 24hrs.

P.S. — If you want to know how to build forms on static sites the easy way checkout my article [Handling forms on static sites with Netlify](/articles/forms-with-netlify/).
