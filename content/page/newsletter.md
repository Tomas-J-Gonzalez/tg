[Braintactics](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca)Â ðŸ¤¯ is a weekly roundup of articles, tools and tips for product designers and front-end developers. Given a good internet connection I send it once a week, on a Friday morning.

## What topics does it cover?

Expect to find anything related to designing and building things for the web. Youâ€™ll find articles on web development, typography, writing, design process and productivity.

Recently Iâ€™ve included interesting things on:  

- HTML and CSS fundamentals
- Building component libraries
- Designing accessible color systems
- Learning CSS grid and flexbox
- Building JAMStack / Serverless websites
- Variable fonts and open source typography
- Creating generative artwork with code

## Whatâ€™s the format?

Each week I begin with a few updates from me, followed by one or two thought provoking reads â€“ maybe an article or a quote from a book Iâ€™m reading.

Though at first these may appear unrelated to design and development, dig a little deeper and youâ€™ll find helpful lessons to apply to your work. After all, reading around your subject is never a bad thing.

For the main part youâ€™ll find links on design and code, as you might expect, and a section on typography. Oliver Reichenstein once said; â€œ[Web design is 95% typography](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period), so itâ€™s only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information.â€œ

I usually wrap the email up with someone to watch. This tends to be an interesting talk or short film I find circulating the web.

You can see [examples from the archive](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) anytime.

## What makes it different?

Unlike most newsletters that do the rounds, all the content from each email is categorised in an Airtable database. Itâ€™s still an ongoing project, but will make searching for content from specific emails much less painful.

To give you an idea of how this works, hereâ€™s a few of the articles Iâ€™ve included:

Ok, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got. If this sound good to you, leave your email below and join me every Friday. [Your email will be kept safe](/privacy/) at all times.
