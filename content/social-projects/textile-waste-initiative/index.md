      ## Overview

      This project aims to give immigrant women the opportunity to celebrate their own cultural background, life journeys and memories through any particular textile crafts inherent to their own culture. With the intention of salvaging and revaluing culture through cloth, the Traveling Sewing Box Project has the objective to appreciate and celebrate the cultural value that immigrant women bring to New Zealand and to create financial and vocational opportunities. The project uses waste minimisation strategies to help minimise textile waste within New Zealand local fashion, clothing and textile industry.
