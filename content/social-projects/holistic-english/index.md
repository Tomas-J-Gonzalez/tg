      ## Overview

      Classes include an array of interactive activities and games that require participants to take part in. The outcome of each course is to illicit proper learning development of the English language. Weaving known and time tested language teaching methodologies together. Teaching that is different from mainstream practice.

      ## Methodology

      We've adopted the ALL Alternative Language Learning methodology. 'Students are considered whole beings whose emotional, cognitive and social processes are cared for throughout the learning process.'

      This methodology is centered on the student - their mind, body and emotions - thus ensuring natural, accelerated and brain-friendly learning. — ALL Method®

      ## Who?

      This learning programme is aimed specifically at Latin American immigrants who are new to the English language and are adjusting to their new life in New Zealand.

      The first classes were held last year with inbound Latin American students. (An ethnic mix of Chilean, Colombian and Argentinean students.) After concluding training from All Method, myself and my colleague, facilitated a total of 10 classes.

      ## Info

      The English course teaches a Basic English aimed at non-English speakers and complete Beginners. The course material/manual is heavily focused on the construction industry within New Zealand, trades/tradie culture, New Zealand slang, common conversation/dialogues, and day in the life scenarios.
