      ## Project Overview

      A collaborative journey to connect students within DCT facilities and enable interdisciplinary collaboration.

      ## Objective

      To be the number one platform students enjoy using to succeed in their studies, assignments and group tasks.

      ## Problem

      Students are feeling an overwhelming pressure in their lives, which is growing due to our demanding societal pressures. One such area of focus for this study is around effective collaboration and group work. This can be seen through:

      1. **A)** Forming and working effectively in a group
      2. **B)** Meeting new people in a course or paper
      3. **C)** Finding like minded students or 'subject area expert' students to study with across the university.
