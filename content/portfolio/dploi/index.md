      ## Project Overview

      Operational system for recruiters to source talent, filter quality applicants, and hire successful applicants. From initial application, to recruitment pipeline, to interview, to assisting with immigration process, and finally to onboarding.

      ## The Problem

      Existing recruitment platforms lack industry-specific features, leading to fragmented tools and inefficient processes for recruiters in New Zealand and Australia.

      ## How Might We?

      I framed up a 'HMW' statement to help clarify the primary goal, taking 'How', 'Who', and 'What' into consideration.

      ## Proto-personas

      The creation of a proto-persona for the project was driven by the need to establish a foundational understanding of our potential users and their anticipated needs. It's important to note that this persona is a prototype, formed primarily from general assumptions rather than empirical data. This proto-persona is not conclusive and requires validation through further research. While it offers a valuable framework for understanding our users, its assumptions need to be verified and refined through further research methods such as interviews, surveys, or observational studies.

      ## Assumption Mapping

      Using IDEO's Desirability, Viability, Feasibility [Framework](https://makeiterate.com/ideos-desirability-viability-feasibility-framework-a-practical-guide/) (DVF) I created some diagrams using Miro to complete an assumption map. The three main question areas were: 1. Do they want this (Yellow), 2. Can we do this? (Blue), and 3. Should we do this? (Green). Of course the assumption map will need to be validated, we don't want to base our design decisions on assumptions.
