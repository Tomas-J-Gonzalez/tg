    heading: "Key Findings"
    content: |
      Usability tests brought some very crucial things to our attention. Students are feeling an overwhelming pressure in their lives, which is growing due to our demanding societal pressures. One such area of focus for this study is around effective collaboration and group work. This can be seen through:
      
      1. **A-** Users struggle to find the page they are looking for. This is due to the poor information hierarchy present on the site.
      2. **B-** Some users struggled to successfully enrol into a paper. They would not realise that they had not confirmed their classes.
      3. **C-** Many users wanted to use the website on their mobile device quickly on the go. The website is currently not mobile friendly.
