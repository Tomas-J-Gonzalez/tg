{{< intro >}}I want this site to be usable by everyone. Here’s what I’m aiming for and how to reach me if something isn’t working.{{</ intro >}}

## Standard and status

- I aim for WCAG 2.2 Level AA.
- Currently partially conformant; I’m improving as I go.

## What I do

- Semantic HTML and clear landmarks
- Keyboard-friendly navigation and visible focus
- Meaningful alt text and labels
- Sufficient color contrast
- Respect reduced‑motion and system settings

## If you need help

- Contact: [Contact page](/contact/) — I usually reply within 2 business days.

## Limits to be aware of

- Complex visuals can be hard to describe in text; I’m adding better captions and alt text. If you need a detailed description, ask and I’ll provide one.
- Third‑party embeds may not fully meet my standard; I’ll offer alternatives where possible.

## Compatibility and testing

- Works on current Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge; macOS, iOS, Windows, Android.
- Tested with VoiceOver, keyboard only, and tools like axe and Lighthouse.
