## About this website

This website is my personal portfolio and blog as an Experience Designer based in Auckland, New Zealand. The site showcases my design work, shares insights on design and development, and provides resources for the design community. As a designer, I believe that digital experiences should be accessible to everyone.

## My commitment to accessibility

I believe that digital experiences should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or the technologies they use. This commitment aligns with my core values as an experience designer and reflects my dedication to inclusive design principles. Accessibility isn't just a technical requirement—it's fundamental to creating good user experiences.

## Accessibility standards applied

This website aims to conform to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA** standard. WCAG is an internationally recognized set of guidelines for making web content accessible to people with disabilities.

## Conformance status

**Partially conformant**: Some parts of the content do not fully conform to the WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standard. I am actively working to improve accessibility and address any identified issues.

## Measures I take to support accessibility

I take the following measures to ensure accessibility of this website:

- **Include accessibility as part of my design philosophy** - Accessibility is fundamental to how I approach design
- **Integrate accessibility into my development practices** - Using semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and accessible design patterns
- **Stay updated with accessibility standards** - Continuously learning about latest accessibility guidelines and best practices
- **Test with accessibility tools** - Regular testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Consider diverse user needs** - Including people with disabilities in my design thinking
- **Regular accessibility audits** - Periodic evaluation of the site's accessibility compliance

## Additional accessibility considerations

Beyond WCAG 2.2 Level AA, I have also applied some Level AAA Success Criteria where possible:

- **Images of text are only used for decorative purposes**
- **Re-authentication after a session expires does not cause loss of data**
- **Content can be presented without requiring horizontal scrolling**
- **Text spacing can be adjusted without loss of functionality**
