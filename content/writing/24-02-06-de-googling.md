I've come to the realisation I use (pretty much) every single Google App. Now I'm doing what I can to minimise my dependence on Google services.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the movement to minimise reliance on major tech giants like Google is gaining momentum. Whether driven by concerns over privacy, data security, or a desire for greater diversification, many individuals are exploring alternatives to Google's suite of services. What are the alternatives?

## Google alternatives

These days there are plenty of great alternatives to Google services. So it's never been easier to start making better choices. Most have a much healthier approach to privacy and security.

## Google Workspace → Tutanota

Transitioning from Google Workspace to Tutanota provides a secure, privacy-focused email solution. Despite some initial quirks, such as image loading settings and email deletion behavior, Tutanota offers a simpler interface and lower cost compared to Google Workspace.

## Google Calendar → Tutanota Calendar

While lacking some features of Google Calendar, Tutanota's encrypted calendar offers basic functionality with custom event colours as a standout feature.

## Google Authenticator → Raivo

Raivo OTP presents an open-source, multi-device compatible alternative to Google Authenticator, providing enhanced security and flexibility in managing two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Google Chrome → Brave

Brave browser serves as a privacy-focused replacement for Google Chrome, offering features such as Brave Rewards and Basic Attention Token (BAT) rewards for users.

## Google Drive → Sync

Sync provides an alternative to Google Drive with encryption and privacy considerations, although not open source. Alternatives like Mega and Filen are also worth exploring for those seeking additional security measures.

## Google Docs → Notion + Obsidian

Notion paired with Obsidian offers a versatile solution for document management and note-taking, with Obsidian providing enhanced security and offline access features.

## Google Sheets → Airtable

Airtable stands as a viable alternative to Google Sheets, offering a more Notion-like interface for managing large datasets.

## Google Maps → Apple Maps

Apple Maps offers privacy-focused navigation solutions, with the latter being particularly useful for public transportation guidance.

## Google Dependencies

Transitioning away from Google services may present challenges, but the availability of privacy-focused alternatives makes the process more feasible than ever before. While maintaining some Google dependencies for specific needs, exploring alternative solutions can lead to a more diversified and privacy-conscious digital experience.

## Google Chrome Browser

Google Chrome is a tricky one to replace. As it is very useful web development and testing. Also, Google search, is just better.

## YouTube

I'm a big fan of YouTube, and can't see myself quitting anytime soon. Some of the best content creators post videos on YouTube, so it's a difficult one to give up. I still use Search Console and YouTube most days.

## Final thoughts

These days there are a bunch of privacy-focused alternatives to Google. So it's never been easier to move away from Google and find a better experience.

Saying that it doesn't look like I'll be going 100% Google free, any time soon.
