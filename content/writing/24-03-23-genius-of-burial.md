In the vast landscape of electronic music, one artist stands out like a shadowy figure in the night: Burial. I've long been fascinated by the enigmatic producer's ability to craft hauntingly beautiful soundscapes.

Here's the album on Bandcamp, [Untrue](https://burial.bandcamp.com/album/untrue). I highly recommend you go and listen.

## The Sound of Urban Decay

It's easy to get lost in the atmospheric textures and intricate rhythms of his tracks.

Listening to "Untrue" feels like exploring a forgotten cityscape at night. It's a testament to his genius and how easily he can evoke such vivid imagery through his music, painting a picture of urban decay with each note.

## The Making of "Untrue"

The stories behind his tracks and the creative process that goes into crafting each track is interesting in itself. From what I've gathered, "Untrue" was inspired by Burial's experiences growing up in the gritty urban landscape of South London, where the sounds of the city became intertwined with his own musical imagination. It's no wonder then that the album is infused with the ambient hum of city life, from the distant rumble of trains to the crackle of vinyl records.

What I found fascinating is that Burial ['William'] produced each track using [SoundForge](https://www.magix.com/us/music-editing/sound-forge/), which I can confidently say is 10x less powerful, and 100x a more complicated audio editing/production software compared to using a modern day DAW [Digital Audio Workstation], such as; Logic Pro X, FL Studio and Abelton Live.

## Emotional Depth and Vulnerability

One of the things I love most about Burial's music is its emotional depth and vulnerability. The haunting vocal samples and melancholic melodies that permeate his tracks, tapping into universal themes of love, loss, and longing. One of my favourite tracks is "In McDonalds".

> Fans testify in a much more alternative-rock way about how his tunes "saved my life." The sound of Burial has touched people, opened them up to difficult emotions, hurt them in valuable ways.

## Legacy and Influence

William (Burial) has had such a huge impact on the electronic music landscape. You could say that "Untrue" is a cultural touchstone that continues to inspire and influence a new generation of artists and musicians. From dubstep to ambient to experimental electronica, Burial's influence can be heard in countless artists who have been inspired by his pioneering sound. It's a sound that transcends genre boundaries and defies easy classification.
