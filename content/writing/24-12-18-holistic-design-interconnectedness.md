Design is often understood as problem-solving - a concept that traces back to Herbert Simon, who defined design as "devising courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones" (The Sciences of the Artificial, 1969). While art speaks emotionally and is open to interpretation, design usually has a clearer purpose: to guide, communicate, or motivate toward a goal. I won't dive deeper into the design vs art debate here - that's just our starting line.

At its core, design involves both identifying and solving problems - but too often, designers skip straight to solutions. They never question the "why," they don't frame the problem effectively, and they fail to consider how their solution will ripple outward in context.

Richard Buchanan identifies this as the challenge of framing wicked problems - complex, shifting issues that demand thoughtful interpretation before you can design (Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, 1992). Without that framing, design becomes decoration.

Ask yourself:
- What problem am I solving?
- Why does it matter?
- How does this solution address it?

If you can't answer those, then swapping a primary button's color just because it "feels better" is arbitrary. Sure, aesthetics influence usability (Norman, Emotional Design, 2004), but they must be anchored in intent and context.

The Inclusive Design Guides remind us:

> "Once we release a solution, it will become part of a larger system… we cannot predict and control who will use our solution and how it will be used." - Inclusive Design Guides (2018)

This is the heart of holistic design: even minor choices live within an evolving system. Every decision carries consequences.

## Real-world ripple effects

Take Facebook's Like button. Introduced in 2009, it was intended as a lightweight way to acknowledge posts - a small, elegant interaction. Yet over time it transformed into a powerful driver of user behavior, fueling algorithmic amplification, "like-chasing" culture, and even mental health concerns tied to social validation. What seemed like a simple UI pattern became a system-wide force, shaping the psychology of billions.

That's interconnectedness in action: a micro-interaction spiraling outward to impact culture, politics, and wellbeing.

By contrast, consider Airbnb adding accessibility filters to its platform. While small in interface terms, it represented a systemic shift: empowering travelers with disabilities, creating new visibility for hosts with accessible properties, and signaling inclusion as a company value. Again, a detail in the interface rippled across people, systems, and perceptions.

## The responsibility of clarity

Paul Rand once said:

> "How to present a new idea is, perhaps, one of the designer's most difficult tasks."

If you can't explain your choices clearly, they're not grounded enough.

Henry Dreyfuss put it bluntly in Designing for People (1955):

> "When the points of contact between the product and the people become a point of friction, then the designer has failed."

A holistic approach asks us to look at those points of contact systemically - beyond immediate usability, toward long-term adaptation, unintended effects, and evolving contexts.

Here's where a powerful lens comes in: asking "How might we…" alongside "At what cost?" As Ida Persson writes:

> "By asking yourself 'How Might We' along with 'At What Cost' you will gain clarity on who stands to gain or lose, what trade-offs might exist, and how you could amplify positive impacts while reducing negative ones." (uxdesign.cc)

This shift forces us to balance curiosity with responsibility. Sometimes the most ethical design decision is not to ship at all.

As Miklos Philips explains:

> "Holistic design takes into account the person, the device, the moment… ethnographic environment, physical space… human behavior and psychology… At times the entire experience… is not limited to digital devices but is a mix of digital, real-world brick-and-mortar, and human-to-human interactions."

Design never exists in isolation. It is always connected - to people, systems, cultures, and environments.

## Before launching

Define the problem clearly.
Question the why - and the cost.
Map the wider system and possible impacts.
Design with intention, responsibility, and explanation.
