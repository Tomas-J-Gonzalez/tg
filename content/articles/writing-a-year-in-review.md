Whilst writing my [year in review](https://harrycresswell.com/tags/year-in-review/) this year it seemed like a good idea and perhaps a useful exercise to outline exactly what this means to me – why I write one and the approach I use to write it. I hope this may in some way be helpful for you too. 

This is very much my own take to what has become an annual practice for many and I follow a format that has so far worked well for me. Here’s everything I can tell you about it. 

## Why I write a review of my year

I was drawn to the idea of writing an annual review after reading Atomic Habits by James Clear and James’s writing at [jameclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/).

James writes; “Improvement is not just about learning new habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary.“

It very much boils down to these things:

- Build good habits
- Reflect to identify what’s working and what isn’t
- Fine-tune, re-focus, drop ineffective habits
- Improve and become the person you wish to become

Reflection gives you a better sense of perspective, makes you more self-aware and helps you identify areas in need of improvement. It helps you reframe your identity and become better at whatever it is you choose to do.

## How I write a review of my year

I use the same format as James for my own review, it’s simple and works well, so I see no reason to change it. By review my progress, I aim to answer the following three questions:

1. What went well this year?
2. What didn’t go so well this year?
3. What did I learn this year?
 
James has his own reasons for asking these three questions which I encourage you to explore further, however I’d like to outline what these mean to me.

By asking “what went well this year” I ensure the year ends on a positive note. It’s so easy to focus on the bad stuff and forget the good things that have happened throughout the year. This question realigns those negative thoughts, encourages a positive mindset and confirms a successful year.

By asking “What didn’t go so well this year?“ I hope to identify the areas I need to improve, so I can begin the year ahead with clear purpose and intention. As Shane Parish writes in The Great Mental Models; “You can’t improve if you don’t know what you‘re doing wrong.” Admitting to your failures is the hardest part. But by doing so we can learn from them and avoid making them again.

Finally, by asking “What did I learn this year?” I remind myself that I’m making progress and heading in the right direction. Often we fall into the trap of thinking we haven’t achieved much or that we’re not on the right track. The answers to this question help prevent these insecurities from manifesting and give ourselves a much needed boost for the year ahead. 

## Final words

Whatever you choose to call it, writing a year in review is a helpful exercise in reflection. Reflection can bring a sense of perspective and writing a review each year can help you identify whether you are becoming the person you wish to become.
