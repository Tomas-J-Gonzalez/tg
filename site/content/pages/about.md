## More about me

I’m an independent product designer from London. My work takes place in the grey area between User Experience Design, User Interface Design and Front-end Web Development. From research and planning to executing high fidelity prototypes and coding, I tend to involve myself in projects from concept through to launch. 

I live between London and Hamburg, where I work with a handful of clients, often remotely. In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking, running and skiing. I practice meditation and yoga most days.
