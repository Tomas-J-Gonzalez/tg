### Personal Projects

[In Detail](https://indtl.com/) is dedicated to immersing you in the beautiful world of fine jewellery via features written by a network of industry commentators, interactive events with industry partners and the newly launched engagement ring concierge service. I co-founded the project back in 2011, with jewellery consultant [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).

[Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.
