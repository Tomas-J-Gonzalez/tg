### Personal

[In Detail](https://indtl.com/). Jewellery focused conetent and concierge service. I co-founded the project back in 2011, with [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).

[Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.

[Mood](https://mood.harrycresswell.com/) is is a visual aid for creative projects – a moodboard of things I like. None of the content is my own.


## Client Work 
[Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/). A Wordpress build with custom theme, Shopify integration and custom weather app. I designed the site in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/).

[Rhythm&Sync](https://rhythmandsync.com/). A simple Hugo site I designed and built for a London based music, sound and visual agency. The site uses Forestry CMS, Cloudinary for media and Netlify for hosting.
  
[AIN Prototypes](http://harrycresswell.co.uk/). I spend a lot of type front-end prototyping. Here’s some of  my work for Angel Investment Network, a platform connecting Investors and startups.

[Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) is an electronic music project by Matt Benyayer. Since 2012 we’ve collaborated on artwork for most releases. You’ll find the music and artwork on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell).
