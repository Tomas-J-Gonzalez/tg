Iâ€™m in Hamburg ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, the weather is a delightful 30Â°c. In between grilling sessions in the park, these are the things Iâ€™m focusing on.

### Current Projects

- Weâ€™re working on [a few changes](https://harrycr.es/2Z6HF7l) to In Detail
- I just finished [wireframing and prototyping SeedTribe v.3.0](https://harrycr.es/2IjtyVF)
- Iâ€™ve been building [a mini jobs board](https://clever-perlman-f0786d.netlify.com/) to test out a new workflow using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) and [Forestry](https://forestry.io/). This is my first crack at building a React app and working with CSS-in-JS. Itâ€™s a steep learning curve but in all honesty itâ€™s been pretty fun so far
