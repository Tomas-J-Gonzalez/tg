I hope this page will give you a clearer picture of ways we can work together and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.

## Who I am

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent UX and product designer based between London, England and Hamburg, Germany. I’ve spent the last 7 years helping startups and individuals turn ideas into fully functional digital products.

## What I do

My work takes place in the grey area between User Experience Design, User Interface Design and Front-end Web Development. 

I can help you conduct research to develop an understanding of your customers needs, develop wireframes and prototypes to test and validate possible solutions, then build and launch a working product. Through usability testing and iteration we can fine tune the product to make improvements.

	
## How I work

I believe product design is about solving real problems for real people. So research, understanding, communication and collaboration are vital to a projects sucess.

I use recognised UX strategies and Lean development practices to keep the process as dynamic and fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction until we find the right solution.  

For larger project I often collaborate with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/). Over the years Luke and I have worked on many successful projects, for a number of well established clients. Recently we helped launched an online presence and eCommerce platform for British cycling brand [Albion](https://www.albioncycling.com/). We continue to work together on a regular basis as part of the [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) team.

## Who hires me

I work with startups and individuals who need a product designer experienced in building businesses from the ground up and launching them online.

My clients tend to be those keen to execute ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Or those who’d rather save on big agency fees by investing their budget in good design from an independent designer, at an affordable rate.

## What I charge

My rate varies from roughly £1.5k — £2.5k per week, depending on the requirements and my involvement in the project. I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

## Get in touch

If you have a project in mind, and you think I might be a good fit, then [let’s talk about it](/contact/) and we can take it from there.
