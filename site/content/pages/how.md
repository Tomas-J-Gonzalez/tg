I hope this page will give you a clearer picture of how I work, how we might work together and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.

## Who I am

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent UX and product designer based between London, England and Hamburg, Germany. I’ve spent the last 7 years helping organisations and individuals build successful businesses online, by taking an idea through to complete digital product.

## What I do

My work takes place in the grey area between User Experience Design, User Interface Design and Front-end Web Development. 

I can help you conduct research to develop an understanding of your customers needs, build wireframes and prototypes to test and validate possible solutions, then through testing and iteration, help you implement product improvements.
	
## How I work

I believe good design is the product of effective collaboration and solving real problems for real people. Prepare to be involved in the process from start to finish. Communication is vital to a projects success, so we’ll keep in regular contact via in person or virtual meetings and email. 

I use recognised UX strategies and Lean development practices to keep the process as dynamic and fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction. 

For larger project I collaborate with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/). Over the years Luke abd I have worked on many successful projects, for a number of well established clients. More recently we’ve worked with the team behind [Albion](https://www.albioncycling.com/), to launch their online presence and eCommerce platform. We continue to work together on a regular basis as part of the [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) team.

## Who hires me

Individuals and startup companies who need a product designer experienced in building businesses online from the ground up.

It tends to be people who want to execute their ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Or those who’d rather save on big agency fees by investing their budget in good design from an independent designer, at an affordable rate.

## What I charge

My rate varies from roughly £1.5k — £2.5k per week depending on the requirements and my involvement in the project. I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

## Get in touch

If you have a project in mind which you feel I might be a good fit for, let’s have a chat about it.[Get in touch](/contact/), telling me a bit about the project and we can take it from there.
