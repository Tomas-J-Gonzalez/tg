{{< intro >}}Hey, I’m Harry, an independent user experience designer and front-end developer from London, England.{{< /intro >}}

{{< pullImage src="v1550264713/hc/harry-cresswell-about-me.jpg" alt="Harry Cresswell – UI/UI Design & Development" >}}

I write [articles on design and code](/articles/) and keep [notes on things I’m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and talks. I also curate [a weekly newsletter](/newsletter/) for designers and front-end web developers. 

I currently live between London and Hamburg, where I work with a handful of clients. In my free time I enjoy running, climbing, hiking and skiing. I practice yoga and meditation most days.
