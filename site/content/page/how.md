I hope this page will give you a clearer picture of how I work and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.

## Who I am

My name is [Harry Cresswell](/about/), I’m an independent designer based in between London, England and Hamburg, Germany. I’ve spent the last 6 years helping small companies and individuals find their feet online, using design and code.

For several years I worked as an in-house designer at Harvey Nichols before setting up my own studio to focus on helping startups and small teams launch their vision and achieve their goals.  

## What I do

Working with small businesses requires a broad skillset. I’m well versed in user experience design, interface design, identity design, front-end development and digital marketing.

I’m one part creative and one part technical, meaning I design and code. Usually I involve myself in projects from concept through to execution. This is the way I enjoy working the most.

My clients usually hire me to do:

- Web Design and Development
- Visual Identity Design
- User Experience/User Interface Designer

I work on projects from the ground up which typically last between 2 and 4 weeks. This is where I find I can provide the most value.

## How I work

I take a collaborative approach on every project, involving clients from start to finish. I  keep in regular contact via in person or virtual meetings and by email.

I aim to keep the process as dynamic as possible, moving thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction. If something isn’t working we’ll revisit the steps until we find what works.

I believe good design is the product of solving real problems for real people. And finding ways to communicate effectively. Having a good working relationship with my clients is also vital for producing results.

Worth noting, [I often collaborate with Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/) on larger projects. Where Luke handles development, I focus my attention on design. Over the years we’ve worked on many successful projects, for a number of well established clients. More recently we’ve worked with the team behind [Albion](https://albioncycling.com/) to launch their online presence and e-commerce platform. We continue to work together with the [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) team on a regular basis.


## Who hires me

Individuals and small teams who need a designer experienced in building businesses online from the ground up.

Normally it’s people who want to execute their brand vision online but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Those who would rather invest their budget in good design at an affordable rate.


## What I charge

When it comes to pricing, I like to be as transparent as possible from the beginning of each project. Budgets can vary, so this prevents wasting your time.

I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

I typically work on projects which last between 2 and 4 weeks. My rate varies from roughly £1.5 — £3k per week depending on the requirements and my involvement in the project.


## Get in touch

If you have a project in mind which you feel I might be a good fit for, let’s have a chat about it. [Get in touch](/contact/), telling me a bit about the project and we can take it from there.
