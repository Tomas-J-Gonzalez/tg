I hope this page will give you a clearer picture of how I work and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.

## Who I am

My name is [Harry Cresswell](/about/), I’m an independent designer based in between London, England and Hamburg, Germany. I’ve spent the last 6 years helping small companies and individuals find their feet online, using design and code.

I worked for several years as an in-house designer at Harvey Nichols before setting up my own studio to focus on helping startups and small teams launch their vision and achieve their goals.  

## What I do

Working with small businesses requires a broad skillset. I’m well versed in user experience design, interface design, identity design, front-end development and digital marketing. You could say I wear many hats.

I’m one part creative and one part technical, meaning I design and code. Usually I involve myself in projects from concept through to execution. This the way I enjoy working the most.

My clients usually hire me to do:

- Web Design and Development
- Visual Identity Design
- digital marketing implementation and strategy

I work on projects from the ground up which typically last between 2 and 4 weeks. This is where I find I can provide the most value.

## How I work

I take a collaborative approach on every project, involving clients from start to finish, keeping regular contact with in person meetings, Skype calls and email.

I aim to keep the process as dynamic as possible, moving thoughtfully, and efficiently in the most appropriate direction. If something isn’t working we’ll revisit the step until we find the right direction.

I believe good design is about good communication. Having a good working relationship with my clients is vital to producing good results.

On certain projects [I collaborate with Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/). We’ve been working together successfully for several years, building [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) and [Albion](https://albioncycling.com/) to name a few.


## Who hires me

Individuals and small teams who need a designer experienced in building businesses online from the ground up.

Normally it’s people who want to execute their brand vision online but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Or people who would rather invest their budget in good design, that comes at an affordable rate. And in a faster timeframe, which an agency can’t offer.


## What I charge

When it comes to pricing, I like to be as transparent as possible from the beginning of each project. Budgets can vary, so this prevents wasting your time.

I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

I typically work on projects which last between 2 and 4 weeks. My rate varies from roughly £2.5 — £5k per week depending on the project requirements and my involvement.


## Get in touch
