If you’re here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience working as a designer and building things on the internet.

I write [articles about my process, design ideas and coding](/articles/). I also record [interesting things I’m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and various other material in the form of notes. I hope you pick up some useful tips whilst you’re here.

## More about me

I’m an independent UI Designer and Front-end Web Developer from London.

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst studying a degree in Fine Art and Art History. I tried a *‘real job’* in Insurance after graduating, but quit in 2010 to focus on making websites full time.

I currently live between London and Hamburg, where I work remotely with a handful of clients. In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking and running. In the winter I like to ski. I practice meditation and yoga most mornings.

### Personal Projects

- [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.
- [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) focuses on visual interviews with jewellery collectors and influencers. I co-founded and continue to work on the project with jewellery consultant [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).

### Things I’ve made

- [Rhythm&Sync](https://rhythmandsync.com/), a simple Hugo site for a London based music, sound and visual agency.
- [AIN Prototypes](http://harrycresswell.co.uk/), a selection of front-end prototypes built for Angel Investment Network related projects.
- [Lulafitness](https://www.lulafitness.co.uk/) is a simple static site built with Hugo.
- [Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/), a Wordpress build with Shopify integration, in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/).
- [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) are an electronic music duo from south London. Since 2012 I have led creative direction of their artwork. You can see each release and listen to their music over on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell).
