If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience **working as a designer** and **building things for the internet**.

When I can I document my design process and record [interesting things I’m reading](/reading/) from books, articles and various other material.

Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## More about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying a degree in Fine Art and Art History. I tried a *“real job”* in Insurance after graduating, but quit in 2010 to focus on **making websites**.

Right now I live between London and Hamburg where **I work remotely** with a handful of clients.

In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking and skiing. I try to meditate and practice yoga every morning.

### Personal Projects

- [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.
- [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) focuses on visual interviews with jewellery collectors and influencers. I co-founded and continue to work on the project with jewellery consultant [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).

### Things I’ve made

- [AIN Prototypes](http://harrycresswell.co.uk/), a selection of front-end prototypes built for Angel Investment Network related projects.
- [Lulafitness](https://www.lulafitness.co.uk/) is a simple static site built with Hugo.
- [Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/), a WP/Shopify buid in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/).
- [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) are an electronic music duo from south London. Since 2012 I have led creative direction of artwork on all their releases. You can see the artwork and listen to their music over on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell).

## Where to go next

There are a few places to go from here. [I write about design systems over on Medium](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell). And share [my ideas about design, code and building products](/articles/) on this site. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell) if you have questions or just want to say hi. To see my full resume head to [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/harrycresswell
