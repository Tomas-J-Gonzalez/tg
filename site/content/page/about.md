## More about me

I’m an independent product designer from London. My work takes place in the grey area between UX and UI design and frontend web development. From problem solving concepts to executing high fidelity mockups and prototypes in code, I involve myself from start to finish. 

I currently live between London and Hamburg, where I work  with a handful of clients, often remotely. In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking, running and skiing. I practice meditation and yoga most days.

### Personal Projects

- [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.
- [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) focuses on visual interviews with jewellery collectors and influencers. I co-founded and continue to work on the project with jewellery consultant [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).

### Things I’ve made

- [Rhythm&Sync](https://rhythmandsync.com/), a simple Hugo site for a London based music, sound and visual agency.
- [AIN Prototypes](http://harrycresswell.co.uk/), a selection of front-end prototypes built for Angel Investment Network related projects.
- [Lulafitness](https://www.lulafitness.co.uk/) is a simple static site built with Hugo.
- [Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/), a Wordpress build with Shopify integration, in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/).
- [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) are an electronic music duo from south London. Since 2012 I have led creative direction of their artwork. You can see each release and listen to their music over on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell).
