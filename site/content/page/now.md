Iâ€™m back in Hamburg, Germany, where itâ€™s begining to feel a lot like Christmas! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

Iâ€™m curretly working my way through [Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript).

And working on [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/).

These are pretty much my priorities right now, but if you want to talk, [drop me a messages](/contact/). Iâ€™m always keen to hear from new people.
