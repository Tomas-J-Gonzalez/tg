I’m back in Hamburg, Germany. It’s Christmas market season. 🎄🎅

If I’m not drinking Glüwein 🍷 I’ll most likly be working my way through [Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) 🤓 or working on [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/). 👨‍🎨

These are pretty much my priorities right now, but if you want to talk, [drop me a messages](/contact/). I’m always keen to hear from new people.
