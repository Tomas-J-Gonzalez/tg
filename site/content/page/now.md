Happy New Year!

Right now Iâ€™m in London. Itâ€™s back to work ðŸ¤“. Mainly on [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) â€“ weâ€™re about to officially launch our latest project ðŸŽ‰.

Iâ€™m still dedicating part of my mornings to [Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) ðŸ¤“ and making plans for [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/).

These are pretty much my priorities right now, but if you want to talk, [drop me a messages](/contact/). Iâ€™m always keen to hear from new people.
