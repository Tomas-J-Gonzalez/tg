I'm in a very cold Hamburg right now where I’m focusing on the following things:

- In Detail new client onboarding.
- Working on my 4th Typeface — TS Sans
- Launch a new blog for a food project

Right now these are my priorities, I'm saying no to most other stuff...saying that, I'm still [open to opportunities](/contact/).

P.S. — We just launched a new look for [In Detail](https://indtl.com/). Go have a look if you haven’t already.
