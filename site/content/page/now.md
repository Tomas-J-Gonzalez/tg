Right now I’m in Kappeln, in the North of Germany. I’ve taken a few weeks off to convert a VW Transporter into a camper van. I’ll be back to work in a few weeks.

Right now this is my priority, but I’m still [open to new opportunities](/contact/).

P.S. — I just hit publish on part 2 of [Sketch Libraries: building a better UI design system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-to-build-a-better-ui-design-system-part-2-8de6cef5adc5).
