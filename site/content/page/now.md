I’m in London and I’m focusing on the following things:

- Building a website for [a new food project](https://www.instagram.com/foodtactics_/)
- Designing my 4th Typeface — TS Sans (which is taking a while!)
- Writing my weekly newsletter

Right now these are my priorities, but I’m still [open to new opportunities](/contact/).

P.S. — I just hit publish on part 2 of [Sketch Libraries: building a better UI design system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-to-build-a-better-ui-design-system-part-2-8de6cef5adc5).
