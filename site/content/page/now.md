I’m in London and I’m focusing on the following things:

- Writing the second part to my Sketch Libraries article.
- Designing my 4th Typeface — TS Sans (which is taking a while!)
- Launching a new website for a food project.

Right now these are my priorities, I’m saying no to most other stuff...saying that, I’m still [open to opportunities](/contact/).

P.S. — We just launched a new look for [In Detail](https://indtl.com/). Go have a look if you haven’t already.
