Thanks for your message! It’s probably flying through the internet right now.

Forgive me if I don’t reply right away, I receive a lot of messages so I now use <a href="http://www.inboxpause.com/">Inbox Pause</a> to limit distraction from email to once per day. You will hear back from me within 24hrs I promise.

P.S. — If you want to know how to build forms on static sites the easy way checkout my article [Handling forms on static sites with Netlify](/).
