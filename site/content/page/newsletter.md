[Brain&mdash;tactics](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) ðŸ¤¯ is a brief, weekly newsletter for creative types which may well improve your skills and enhance your brain capacity. Given a good internet connection I send it out every week on a Friday.

## What topics does it cover?

Topics range from designing and building websites to typography, illustration and music. Recently Iâ€™ve included a whole bunch of good stuff from various corners of the internet, including things on:

- Building design systems
- Using CSS grid
- Getting good with typography
- Creating artwork with code

You can see examples [from the archive](http://us14.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) anytime.


## Why is this better than the rest?

Glad you asked. Unlike most other newsletter out there, Brainâ€”tactics includes a table. But perhaps thatâ€™s not quite doing it justice.

Think more along the lines of a searchable database, containing each and every piece if content ever featured in the emails I send out.

Hereâ€™s a quick preview of video content Iâ€™ve included:

Ok, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got. If this sound good to you, leave your email below and join me on this wild ride. I will guard your email with my life.
