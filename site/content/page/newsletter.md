[Brain&mdash;tactics](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) ðŸ¤¯ is a brief, weekly newsletter for creative types which may well improve your skills and enhance your brain capacity. Given a good internet connection I send it out every week on a Friday.

## What topics does it cover?

Topics range from designing and building websites to typography, illustration and music. Recently Iâ€™ve included a whole bunch of good stuff from various corners of the internet, including things on:

- Building design systems
- Using CSS grid
- Getting good with typography
- Creating artwork with code

You can see examples [from the archive](http://us14.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) anytime.


## What makes so good?

Glad you asked. Unlike most newsletters that do the rounds, all the content from Brainâ€”tactics is recorded and categorised in a searchable [Airtable database](https://airtable.com/). No more searching your inbox for that font bookmarking tool featured in [issue 39](https://mailchi.mp/ca2d3fa2a35c/new-in-detail-design-systems-book-font-bookmarking).

Hereâ€™s some of the video content, to give you an idea of whatâ€™s included:

Ok, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got. If this sound good to you, leave your email below and join me every Friday. [Your email will be kept safe](/privacy/) at all times.
