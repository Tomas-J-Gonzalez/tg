By signing up for my mailing list you are agreeing to receive an email from me containing useful content, once a week on a Friday and that’s it.

In compliance with the [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) I have no intention of selling you anything, advertise to you or of passing your data on to any 3rd parties.

The only data I keep is your first name and email address. I store it securely inside my Mailchimp account and use a password generator and 2 factor authentication, so ain’t nobody getting up in there.

I no longer use Analytics or any other form of data tracking tools on this website.
