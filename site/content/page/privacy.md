By signing up for my mailing list you are agreeing to receive an email from me containing useful content, once a week on a Friday and thatâ€™s it.

In compliance with the [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) I have zero intention of trying to sell you anything, advertising to you or selling your data to any 3rd party service.

If you no longer wish to here from me by email [please unsubscribe now](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/unsubscribe/post) and that will be that.


The only data I keep is your first name and email address, securely inside the armoured walls of Mailchimp. I no longer use Analytics or any other form of data tracking tools on this website.
