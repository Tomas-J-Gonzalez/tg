By signing up for my mailing list you are agreeing to receive an email from me containing useful content, once a week on a Friday and that’s it.

I have no intention of selling you anything, advertising or passing your data on to any 3rd party services.

In compliance with the data and privacy laws (“GDPR”), effective of May 25th 2018, I only email people who have genuinely signed up to receive my newsletter each week.

The only data I keep is your first name and email address. I store it securely inside my Mailchimp account and use a generated password from 1Password and 2 factor authentication in order to keep it safe.
