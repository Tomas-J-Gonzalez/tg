In Stephen King’s [On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing), he writes, “Write what you like, then imbues it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. People love to read about work. God knows why, but they do.” He continues, “What you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.”

What makes sense about this, is first the importance telling good stories. Story telling is one of humanities great successes. From the days we sat around campfires stories have been told, to guide and educate, also to entertain. When you sit down to write, it’s worth remembering that people connect best with stories, they’re the greatest way we know how to package and deliver valuable knowledge and our experience of the world. We use stories to guide others on a path less traveled. 

The second thing is the importance of wrapping stories with personal experiences. I write about my work, so I feel I’m on track, but often I catch myself – what may be considered – lecturing. Perhaps at times I’m guilty of not sharing enough of the story behind the work I do.

This is helpful in other respects too. At times I feel hard pushed to write. “I’m a designer”, I say to myself, “I’m not a writer”. What I forget is that none of us are writers, not really. Writing just happens to be the medium we use to share the things we love doing. So whether the aim is to spread a message or get a point across, it really doesn’t matter. If you want to help others by explaining what you do and the way you do it, then good for you. Even if you’re just trying to make sense of your thoughts and understand the way you approach the work you do, that’s fine too. Whatever your aim may be, it’s important to remember the reason you write. And that’s to share your experiences and make sense of the world around you. It’s to tell great stories about the things you enjoy most. 

For me, it’s never been about the writing and I’m sure it’s not for you either. It’s always been about design and sharing my experiences of designing. So when I’m stuck in a rut, and fed up with writing, I must remind myself the reason why I sat down to write in the first place. My mission, if you will.

Here’s a quote from King worth rememebering , “Write about anything you damn well want. Anything at all… as long as you tell the truth.”
