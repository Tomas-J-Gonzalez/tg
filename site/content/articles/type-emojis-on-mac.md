{{< intro >}}Itâ€™s hard to avoid Emojiâ€™s these days. Whether you like using them on not theyâ€™re a great way to help visually communicate your thoughts and ideas.{{< /intro >}}

We all know how to use Emojiâ€™s on a phone but do you know how to access the Emoji panel on a mac?

The Mac Emoji keyboard shortcut is really easy to remember, whilst your cursor is in type mode, use the shortcut: `Command + Control + Spacebar` to bring up the Emoji character panel.

Then select the Emoji to type it. The panel works exactly the way it does on an iPhone. Easy peasy! ðŸ¤™
