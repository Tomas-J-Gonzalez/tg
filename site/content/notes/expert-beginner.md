A few weeks back my girlfriend showed me an interesting way of building responsive grids without using media queries. The technique uses CSS Grid and the CSS `minmax()` function, and until that point I didn’t know it. Whatsmore, before 3 months ago she’d never written a line of code. 

This is exactly what I love about building stuff for the web –  things move fast and there’s always exciting new ways of doing things, often better ways than the ones you already know. At times you might find yourself learning these techniques from developers who are just starting out. Regardless of their inexperience, they may know something you don’t, because in this industry it’s impossible know it all.
 
Rachel Andrew sumed up this idea perfectly in [a recent tweet]:

“I love that in this industry you get to be an expert and a beginner at the same time. Learning new things, being a beginner, reminds me what that is like and makes me a better teacher of the things I am expert in.”

When there’s always something new to learn it can feel overwhelming, particularly for new developers. Should I learn hot new framework X or Y, we’ve all been there. I think it’s fair to say it happens to most of us, regardless of our experience. 

But there are two ways you can approach this problem; you can either let it get to you and become despondent or choose to view this as an incredible opportunity, to be both beginner and expert and have have confidence knowing you have something just as valuable to teach as you have to learn, regardless how long you’ve been building things for the web. Personally I suggest choosing the latter.

The lesson here is that approaching your work with a beginners mind and adopting an attitude of openness, by valuing the teachings of both beginners and experts alike, will make you a better developer. And likewise, as a new developer it’s important to value what little you may have learned and find confidence in knowing you can be both expert and beginner, and teach others, with very little experience.
